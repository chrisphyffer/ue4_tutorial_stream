**In no way does this repo serve as an endorsement or even a promotion of Epic Games Inc. or any of it's products.**

This is also not an endorsement of CN/RS (I used to like the show!)

This repo is simply the result of an Online Stream I did back in December 2016. I wanted to make a Steven Universe fighting game and walked through how I developed the character, from Sculpture, to Blender Preparation, to Animation, Import, then simple Game Logic, within the span of a week and a few days.

Enjoy!
